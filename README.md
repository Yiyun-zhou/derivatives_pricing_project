# Derivatives Pricing (Python)

This is a focused mini-project on **derivatives pricing and risk analytics**, implemented in Python.  
It covers **European and American options**, multiple pricing approaches (Binomial Tree, Monte Carlo, Black–Scholes closed-form), key **Greeks**, and **implied volatility** estimation.  
Extensions include **variance reduction techniques** and **continuous dividend yield** support.

## 📝 Project Status
- **First Version Released:** 2025-09-15  
- **Last Update:** 2025-10-08

### Planned Extensions
- [ ] Additional Greeks (Theta, Rho)  
- [ ] Exotic options prototypes (Asian, Barrier)  *Note: Barrier done on 10-08-2025*
- [ ] Volatility Surface deeper extensions (sticky-delta, sticky-strike)

## 🚀 Quickstart (macOS / VS Code)

```bash
# 1) Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2) Upgrade pip and install dependencies
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"
# or:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Enable the venv in VS Code
# (bottom-right prompt or Cmd+Shift+P → Python: Select Interpreter)

# 4) Run tests
pytest

# 5) Try example scripts
python src/deriv_pricing/binomial.py
python src/deriv_pricing/monte_carlo.py
```
